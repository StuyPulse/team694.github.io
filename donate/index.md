## [Our Wish List](http://a.co/1eQnqv8)

Our robotics team is becoming a greater presence in the Stuyvesant community, with over 150 members in our three robotics teams. With more students joining every year and more projects being done, lots of our equipment and materials are dwindling and getting old. In order to provide students with state-of-the-art materials and more opportunities so that they can continue doing the things they do, we need YOUR help.

Please consider contributing to the Stuyvesant Robotics Team by donating an item from our wish list. If you would rather make a monetary contribution, please send an email to <info@stuypulse.com>.

Thank you so much for your continuous support and contribution to the team!
