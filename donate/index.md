Our robotics team is becoming a greater presence in the Stuyvesant community, with over 150 members in our three robotics teams. With more students joining every year and more projects being done, lots of our equipment and materials are dwindling and getting old. In order to provide students with state-of-the-art materials and more opportunities so that they can continue doing the things they do, we need YOUR help.

If you or your company wishes to donate, please click on the donate button above or contact us at <info@stuypulse.com>. 

Thank you so much for your continuous support and contribution to the team!
