title: 3rd Annual StuyPulse Bloomberg Coat Drive 
---
Donate gently used coats in the bin next to the printing station until November 27th. All coats will be matched by Bloomberg and donated to the New York Cares coat drive.
Red Cross is giving 2 volunteer hours for your first coat, and 1 hour for every additional coat up to 10 hours! Please write your full name, 4 digit ID, OSIS and # of coats on the bag if you would like to receive hours.

## Start a Collection!
We encourage students and families to set up collections in their own buildings, schools and communities. Flyers can be found below.
If you collect more coats than you can carry, contact cobysontag@gmail.com and we may be able to help!

New York Cares has distributed almost two million coats over thirty years of coat drives. Last year over 100,000 coats were delivered to New Yorkers in need. By donating through StuyPulse and Bloomberg you double your impact, as Bloomberg LP will match every coat donate!
