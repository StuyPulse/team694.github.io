Bag-and-tag day has come and gone... [ intro ]

You can read a recap of the past six weeks under the cut.

##Weeks 1-2##

During the first two weeks of build season, the engineering division split up into several groups to work on various prototypes for mechanisms involving tote movement, and including hooks, a forklift, arms, and the kchka, which allows tote movement from bottom to top (ie stack totes by lifting bottom tote and putting on single tote).

The prototypes were finished by the end of week 2, after which we decided on the mechanisms we wanted to use on our robot. We ultimately chose to use the hook to lift up totes, as this was the simplest and most viable option (compared to the other prototypes, which were either too complex, or simply did not work at all). We also chose to use arms for the acquirer, which pulls the totes in from their sides.

During this time, we used CAD to design the various robot mechanisms, and put everything together in one single CAD to make sure there would be no conflicts between the placement of any parts of the robot. (Mention names?) These drawings were referenced when creating the actual parts so there would be as few errors as possible.

##Week 6##

For the last week of build season, the robot was handed over to the software engineering division for general code and auton tests. We discovered issues with the encoders, and had to adjust the distance calculations accordingly. After all the code was tested, we still had time left over for driver practice (hooray!). Our drive team got pretty good at maneuvering the robot and stacking totes.

##Bag and Tag Day##

Finally, the last day of build season came. We got a lot of driver practice in, and even melted the pnuematics because we ran the robot for too long.

Around 8:30 PM, we covered the robot with bubble wrap and saran wrap and bagged it before Mr. Colón finally put on the tag.

Now, all we have to do is find a crate tall enough to fit our robot...
