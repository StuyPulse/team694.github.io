### Tutorials

#### [Fundraising](/resources/tutorials/fundraising/)

Fundraising is a very important aspect of maintaining any FIRST Robotics team. Here is a guide to help you raise money.

#### [How to Recruit](/resources/tutorials/recruitment/)

A robotics team can sound very intimidating to a high school student, especially one who has no prior experience. However, the more people on a team, the more ideas and manpower the team has, and the better the robot will inevitably be. Here are a few ways to help your team grow and retain anywhere from over ten to over one hundred members.

#### [Video Production](/resources/tutorials/videoproduction/)

Creating videos for or about your team can be fun or can very tedious. Whether your experience are one or the other is dependent on how you carry out all the parts of the video production process.
