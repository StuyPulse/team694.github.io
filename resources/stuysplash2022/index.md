title: Stuy Splash 2022
---
[Stuy Splash](/community/projects/stuysplash/) is an intensive camp for FRC, covering everything from the foundation of your robot to the 0's and 1's that make it overweight.

In 2022, we held StuySplash at Stuyvesant High School on December 10. Below are the presentations from the event.

### Impact 101 <small>with Philip Liu</small>
[Presntation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OIbd2HAb9EnMcABCGouYjB7rslT6q-wxfPN30wkuRoc/edit?usp=sharing)

### "Less is More: Making Better Picks With Less Scouting Data and Better Analytics" <small>with Brian Maher</small>
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J54mtba0JIrZHcc3ltNG1Q1x0YTagGDwXvZA4N5o338/edit?usp=sharing)

> Many teams collect too many different scouting data points, which requires unnecessary effort from scouting students and can lead to less accurate data. We'll talk about how to make collecting scouting data easier for your team by only collecting the information you'll actually need and strategies for most effectively analyzing/visualizing that data.

### Various Case Studies to Remember<small>with Howard Cohen</small>
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U6RHz9kWBy72p-ordl0WhlDVAGWjZvc4fbhv-jcSWSM/edit?usp=sharing)

> Join us as we look at a variety of problems and how the great minds of then and today looked at them. Take home some guiding principles from the challenges that happen in the real world and can help in the future. Will you be able to solve the puzzles?

### WPLIB Beta Testing <small>with Vincent Wang and Ivan Chen</small>
