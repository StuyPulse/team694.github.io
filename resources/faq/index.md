### Do I have to have experience to join?
Nope! Our robotics team accepts all students regardless of their experience. In fact, we have lessons to teach new members before the competition season begins. These involve hands-on experiences with parts or learning from slides while using laptops that we provide.

### Are the meetings mandatory?
Nope! It is completely up to you on whether you want to come to the meetings. If students are preoccupied with schoolwork or can't attend a meeting due to other reasons, it's fine to miss one. However, it's recommended that students attend meetings often because they need to learn the curriculum for their specific department.

### What departments are there?
There are a total of three main departments: Engineering, Software Engineering, and Marketing. Members from all departments can join the Strategy department as well. When you first join the team you are free to join as many as you want, but you will need to choose one later on in the season.

### What do I need to do to join?
You will need to fill out the team forms, which can be found [here](/resources/forms/). In addition, you will need to pay team dues ($100) and pass a safety exam. Once you have turned in all your forms, a stuypulse.com email will be created for you. 

### How do I know if all my forms are turned in?
You can log into [Team Manager](https://manage.stuypulse.com) with your stuypulse.com email to check the status of your documents. It may take a while for your forms to be processed.
