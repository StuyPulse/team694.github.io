[Stuy Splash](/community/projects/stuysplash/) is an intensive camp for FRC, covering everything from the foundation of your robot to the 0's and 1's that make it overweight.

In 2017, we held Stuy Splash at Stuyvesant High School on December 4. Below are the presentations from the event.

> "Presenting and answering questions is different in person than on Zoom/Teams. In this interactive session, attendees will learn tips they can use at the 2022 competition. Whether you are presenting Chairmans or encountering a judge in the pit, youâ€™ll be prepared to communicate effectively! Jeanne Boyarsky is a Distinguished Toastmaster and has given over a hundred speeches. She has also written six books about Java and will be giving away a copy to one of the attendees."
