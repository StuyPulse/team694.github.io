[Stuy Splash](/community/projects/stuysplash/) is an intensive camp for FRC, covering everything from the foundation of your robot to the 0's and 1's that make it overweight.

In 2021, we held Stuy Splash at Stuyvesant High School on December 4. Below are the presentations from the event.

### Presenting in person! Communicating for Chairmans and Pit Interviews <small>with Jeanne Boyarsky</small>
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c716GScX0mzcnDAIznfAcWcDShFhdcn6/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117641438514045868531&rtpof=true&sd=true)

> Presenting and answering questions is different in person than on Zoom/Teams. In this interactive session, attendees will learn tips they can use at the 2022 competition. Whether you are presenting Chairmans or encountering a judge in the pit, youâ€™ll be prepared to communicate effectively! Jeanne Boyarsky is a Distinguished Toastmaster and has given over a hundred speeches. She has also written six books about Java and will be giving away a copy to one of the attendees.

### Intro to FRC Awards <small>with Ian Codner, Izzy Jia, & Manolee Merlet</small>

> 

### How to Analyze FTC Robot Games For Success <small>with Eileen Kuo & Sinan Roumie</small>
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13kD5RFwNN5SWCgJHRploBdMRVvhd0AP-q254TjuV5xs/edit?usp=sharing)

[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1koR_LJUQr0Bl9JbjXiroavUQUp-aPUIsiXEXa5tInns/edit?usp=sharing)

> This presentation is designed to give FRC students a better idea of how to effectively organize and schedule their build and competition seasons as well as how to go about making decisions as a team. This presentation is targeted at helping students and mentors get ready for the upcoming season after a very long break from building robots.

### 2022 FRC Beta Testing <small>with Nicky Lin</small>
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F00SK0r5_fpESj5BRldIC0qP32ThpbPQUoDMvAnivJs/edit?usp=sharing)

> How to render everything from a table to robots using Fusion360. We will learn about how to manipulate appearances and scene settings to produce high quality renderings.

### Leadership in FIRST <small>with Levi Olevsky</small>

> What is one skill that every single person on a FIRST team should have? A good leader will be able to not only manage, but enhance the skills of their team, regardless if the team is two people or one hundred. Come learn what I think it takes to be a good leader.

### Life of a Mechanical Engineer <small>with Howard Cohen</small>
