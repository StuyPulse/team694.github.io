title: Stuy Splash 2015 Presentations
---
[Stuy Splash](/community/projects/stuysplash/) is an intensive camp for FRC, covering everything from the foundation of your robot to the 0's and 1's that make it overweight.

In 2015, we held Stuy Splash at Stuyvesant High School on December 12. Below are the presentations from the event.

### Team Organization, Marketing, and Finance <small>with Yubin Kim</small>
> The team organization of a team is one of the most crucial parts of running a successful team. StuyPulseâ€™s elaborate team structure and intercommunication between departments allows it to stay organized. Our marketing heads the logistics.

### Pneumatics <small>with Noah Tom-Wong</small>
> Pneumatics, pneumatics, pneumatics. It's that annoying air system running through robots that is constantly leaking. How does it work anyway? Well, we're here to help! Pneumatics are an excellent method of actuation, and provide a stunning amount of variety for something so simple. This lecture will quickly pass over basic topics and move into some fun ideas that you can use with solenoid valves, pistons, and other pneumatic components. This lecture will make sure you can get a head start in how to make a working pneumatic system on the hardware side.

### FLL Mentoring <small>with Noah Tom-Wong</small>
> FLL, that game with Lego robots. Mentoring might seem easy, it might seem tough. FLL actually consists of two components: research and robotics. This lecture will show you all you need to know in order to get a head start in mentoring FLL. You should do it, it's fun! This is a completely intro course wherein if you have had FLL experience prior this presentation might not be informative.

### Habits for Good Software Developers <small>with Eric Lam</small>
> Sometimes while writing software you think to yourself "I don't need to document this. It's so simple." Then later someone else looks at it and has no idea what is going on. So you look at it. You have no idea what is going on. There are many simple things one can do to create robust code. Though robot code might not be the most complicated code logically, every single thing helps other team members, future team members, and yourself.

### Beta Seminar <small>with Ethan Cheng</small>
> Come and learn about the new FIRST software that will be used in the 2016 season.

### GitHub Workflow for Open Source Software <small>with Justin Kim</small>
> One of the advantages of using a VCS like Git is its contribution features. GitHub gives teams an easy, effective way to peer-review code and ensure code quality throughout the build season.

### Intro to Engineering and Programming in FTC <small>with Sarah Chen</small>
> Interested in FTC? Learn about what FTC is and the best practices Stuyvesant FTC has found effective over the year.

### When are we going to start building robots? <small>with Dan Lavin (Mentor)</small>
> This year's competition made it clear that manually controlled machines like ours won't win against robots with automated systems. It's time to step up our game and learn how to automate common functions for better speed and accuracy.

### FIRST Robot Inspection <small>with Howard Cohen</small>
> Prevent competition day disasters, know what can pass and what will not. Knowing is half the battle, join us as we talk about commonly used defined words such as frame perimeter and COTS. You need to be in the competition to win the competition. This workshop will cover commonly defined criteria for robot inspection and how to understand the numerous rules that govern what our robots can and cannot do.

### CAD: Finite Element Analysis <small>with Jion Fairchild</small>
> Over the course of this lecture I will go over the basics of computer assisted design in Solidworks. Solidworks is a program that allows you to design and build 3D models of parts, mechanisms, and assemblies. Over the course of the lecture I will go over the basics of designing parts, putting them together, and running simulated stress tests on them. Solidworks is willing to sponsor any FIRST team that asks for a FIRST sponsorship and will provide Solidworks licenses as necessary depending on the size of your team. If you would like to follow along with the lecture, feel free to bring a laptop that has Solidworks installed.
