title: FLL Curriculum

It all began in the spring of 2001 when Team 694 gave a presentation about instituting a robotics curriculum to interested teachers. Since then, we have helped inspire several schools to get involved in this spectacular program. In addition, Team 694 has been there to lend a helping hand by mentoring teams, especially I.S. 89 across the street whom we have mentored each year since 2002.

Our involvement with FLL increased in December 2005 when the Manhattan Borough FLL Tournament was first held in our school. After last year’s successful event, the great amount of experience gained was used to make this year’s tournament even better. This year we also worked to upgrade our event to the standards of an official FIRST event. We also continued to send volunteers to help referee and queue teams at the NYC FLL tournament in Riverbank State Park as well as the Queens FLL Qualifier.

As of 2019, we helped a variety of FLL Teams in Puerto Rico. More specifically, we aided in programming and their project presentations. These four teams were the ASJ Robotigers, Knight Hackers, The LEGO Builders and The Robogens.

Recently, as of 2021, we’ve also devised our own FLL curriculum, designed specifically to help new teams and their mentors get a solid foundation in the basics of FLL robotics and its associated activities such as the FLL research project.
