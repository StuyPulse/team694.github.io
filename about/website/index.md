title: About This Website
description: StuyPulse.com was built in 2013 using Jekyll and Boostrap, and the source code is available on Github.
---
The current iteration of StuyPulse.com, which launched in February 2013, replaced the aging PHP framework and website design which had been in use since 2008. Originally developed by the StuyPulse Web Team of 2013, led by webmasters Kevin Wang and Sungwoo Park, the 2013 StuyPulse.com reboot was both a functional and visual modernization endeavor.

### The Nitty Gritty
Rather than relying on a complex content management system to serve content, this website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a "simple, blog aware, static site generator" written in Ruby. As a purely static site, no server-side processing is necessary after the site is initially built. Furthermore, our site is hosted on GitHub Pages, resulting in extremely fast page load times.

Much of our content is formatted with Markdown, which gets converted into HTML when the site is built. This makes it easy for team members to add content to the site without any HTML experience, while avoiding the complexity of using a CMS with a WYSIWYG page editor.
