title: 'Woodie Flowers Nomination: Ron Kunicki'
---
“Dedicated,” “resourceful,” “precise,” “compassionate,” “funny,” - who is this jolly ole
mentor who never fails to show up to save the day? None other than engineer and “father of
the team,” Ron Kunicki. Not only has his easygoing nature captured our hearts and minds, his
dedication to FIRST has given him an essential role on our team. When asked why he was so
committed, he replied, “With team 694, my mind continues to be entertained, and sometimes
I even have to go home and research the problems the team asks me.” Whatever the reason,
Ron's leadership and dedication have become a vital part of the team.

Ron brought more than his expertise as an architect to our team; he also brought
knowledge that can only be acquired from years of experience. In our lab, Ron is considered
the authority on everything related to machining, but his innate understanding of how machines
function is what surprises us most. At a time when our team depended on the creation of a solid
design for our 2006 robot's tower, Ron helped fabricate a spiral mechanism that pushed us to
the finals in the 2006 New York Regional. Ron not only utilized his skills to benefit the entire
team, but also worked to create a new generation of machinists by teaching anyone needing a
helping hand.

“I have a fun job, I help people,” Ron said of his involvement in our team. “Teachers
like Mr. Colón \[our faculty advisor\], do not necessarily have the time to work on everything,
so I come in.” Almost everyone on the team has a story to tell about how Ron helped them,
and when he's in the lab, he's usually seen patiently teaching new members. Said one
freshman, “He focuses on us individually and treats us like people, not projects.” He also shows
the most skilled members of our team how to make the leap between abstract concepts and
concrete designs.

Ron is one of the most devoted members of our team. Despite working a full time job,
he never fails to find time to help us. Since his daughter Theo joined the team four years ago,
Ron has become a recognizable part of the team. Ron is the only mentor who we can count on
to always be at lab meetings, fund-raising events, outreach events, competitions, etc. He even
opens his own home to us as a meeting place for brainstorming sessions after kick-off every
year. His station wagon becomes a shuttle for food, candy, and building materials during build
season as well as parts, tools, and people during competitions. When our team was short on
conduit piping needed to build arm prototypes, it was Ron who brought in piping so we could
continue to test our designs. Ron's dedication and commitment to the team has inspired the
team in ways that no other mentor ever had.

Ron Kunicki has guided the future of our team, provided us with enormous support,
and sacrificed his free time, energy, money, and his house to support our team. His wife,
Catherine Kunicki, complements him well, serving as a devoted volunteer to NYC/NJ FIRST
and a dedicated team parent, even winning the Volunteer of the Year award at New York in
2007. Our team is deeply indebted to the Kunicki's and we are greatly honored that both of them
will continue to support us and FIRST even after their daughter Theo Kunicki graduates from
Stuyvesant. We hope that you, the judges, recognize the amazing work Ron Kunicki has done
by awarding him this year's Woodie Flowers Award.
