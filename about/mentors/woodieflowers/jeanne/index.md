Jeanne Boyarsky, Team 694's mentor, has dedicated herself to FIRST for
four years.  In that time, not only has she volunteered at the NYC Regional,
served as a judge for FLL competitions, and co-run NY FIRST's presence at the
World Maker Faire, but the significance of her programming mentoring can be
seen across all departments of our team. Jeanne's passionate and professional
involvement with robotics has not only led our team to success, but has also
taught us valuable skills that will be useful for years to come.

A technology expert in the banking industry, Jeanne's experience and
leadership skills have allowed her to teach professionalism in software
development and effective communication among team members. Her friendly
attitude has also transformed many new members who are at first shy and
undecided into experienced and confident veterans, inspiring them to further
pursue their interests in STEM. As Blake Elias, a StuyPulse senior, said, “Jeanne
is patient and she sits down with new members to talk to them, explore their
potentials, and make them feel involved”.

Jeanne joined our team the year that Java was introduced as a language
for teams. As a professional Java developer and with her expert explanations and
demonstration, Jeanne was able to teach us how to code in Java from scratch.
That same year, Jeanne led our team to develop a control system that won the
Innovation in Control Award at the NY Regional.

Aside from teaching us version control, unit testing, and software
debugging practices, Jeanne taught us to be strategists and to maximize our time
and efficiency. Jeanne standardized our procedures on documenting information
and resources. She taught team members to collaborate and to write code that
others can understand.

To Jeanne, robotics is not only about building a robot. As she says, “There
are all the subtle things that become part of them, like team work. When they
don't realize they are learning, they learn more.”

Jeanne's involvement goes beyond StuyPulse. Not only has she recruited
many new mentors for rookie teams, but when Jeanne heard that the Steel
Hawks did not have a programming mentor, she began assisting them as well.

Patricia Daly, regional director of New York FIRST, has said, “Jeanne is
one of the key volunteers in our FIRST Robotics program in NYC …. She is an
ambassador … for FIRST and her efforts have gotten us new financial sponsors
and coaches/mentors for new teams.” Jeanne also acts as a liaison between
StuyPulse and FIRST. She mobilized our team throughout the beta testing
process. Her blog has helped record the growth of our team and her presence has
encouraged many female students to join FIRST.

Jeanne encourages others to discover their own talents. Her Socratic
Method of giving advice as questions makes members think and allows them to
be decisive.

How does Jeanne explain her dedication? “Watching them grow from
knowing nothing, to discovery, to mastery, is why I am on the team. I love to
watch them learn.”
