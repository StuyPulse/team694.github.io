Our 2018 robot, Wildcard, was named in honor of our new robotics coach, Joe Blay. Throughout the season, Wildcard managed to reach Rank 5 during its first regional being the Central New York Regional of Week 1. This positive trend continued with the Hudson Valley Regional, where Wildcard was Rank 2. At the New York City Regional, Wildcard accomplished an unforgettable accomplishment, True Blue. Our team had won the Chairman’s Award, Woodie Flowers Award and was deemed Regional winners, awarding StuyPulse with three blue banners. At FRC’s Detroit Championship, Wildcard ranked 8th in the Archimedes Division, ending our FIRST Robotics season.
