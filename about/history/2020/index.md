Our 2020 robot, Edwin, was named after Alfred's brother, Edwin. Thanks to their donation, Stuyvesant High School has been able to build a new robotics lab. During the very short 2020 robotics season, Edwin went undefeated at the Palmetto Regional, winning the regional and the Innovation in Control award.
