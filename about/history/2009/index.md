As Stuypulse entered the 2009 season, we prepared once more for the challenge given to us.  After a season of hard work and perseverance, our robot, Michael1, was born. He was by a long measure the best and most effective robot we have ever built. This powerful machine was quick, efficient, and best of all, had some serious personality: glaring eyes and a grinning mouth just waiting to acquire moon rocks.  In our ninth year, we were truly up to "Lunacy," the name of the 2009 game. Michael 1 was by far our best ever robot. It suffered zero mechanical failures throughout the entire season. We went to the semi-finals at both the New York City and Connecticut Regionals. By the end of the season we were ranked second in the world, out of over 2000 teams, in terms of calculated contribution to an alliance.
