FIRSTConnects.Us started out in response to Dean's Homework, a challenge to keep track of FIRST Robotics alumni. When it was first written, it was a database of all team members, mentors, alumni, and FIRST volunteers, and it grew to hold hundreds of users from around the globe.

Since then, it has been greatly expanded in conjunction with the New York FIRST Student Leadership Assembly (NYFSLA), an organization of NY FIRST teams. Now featuring a media hub, team and personal blogs, a help forum, and a community calendar in addition to its original database and messaging system, FCU, as we call it, is ready to help all teams through the rigorous build and off seasons.

FCU is powered by Drupal 7, the CMF that is behind sites from the White House to NPR. For more information on Drupal, visit their [official website](http://drupal.org/){:data-proofer-ignore=""}.
