title: Team Manager
---
In an effort to better unify and organize the logistics and paperwork of our team, our web team has developed the Team Manager. The Team Manager interface allows team leaders to conveniently record and organize members' information much more effectively than with a traditional spreadsheet. Tracking the status of forms and documents (such as safety tests, team dues, medical documents, trip permission forms, etc.) has never been easier.

This project is open source, so others are free to fork our code and adapt it for their own teams. Check out the [source code](https://github.com/StuyPulse/teammanager)!
