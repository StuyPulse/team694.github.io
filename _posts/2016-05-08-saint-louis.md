While others spent their spring break catching up on work and relaxing, StuyPulse competed in the 2016 FIRST championships at St. Louis. Every year we make it our goal to make it to Einstein, and this goal was finally fulfilled with our division winning robot, DEStiny. The competition started off very well during qualification matches, with our team ranking 8th out of all 75 individual teams in the Curie division. However, after qualifications, StuyPulse received heart-breaking news from the pit crew: the wheel hubcaps shattered which sheared the bolts holding together the center wheels on our drivetrain. Even after hearing this news, we remained unfazed. We continued to hold our heads high and on that night came up with the picklist that would determine this competition for us. On the final day of the championships, StuyPulse made an alliance with team 3339, team 379, and team 1511. With epoxy and hope holding together their drivetrain wheels, StuyPulse and its alliance members progressively made it through quarterfinals, semifinals, finals and became Curie division winners. Although StuyPulse did not get past quarterfinals on Einstein field, they did manage to come home with a win on the Curie field. With the conclusion of the competition season, we prepares for offseason events and the next year with a new resolve.
