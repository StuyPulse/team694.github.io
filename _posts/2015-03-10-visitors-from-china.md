Over the next two days, three Chinese FRC teams ([Team 5452](http://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5452), [Team 4830](http://www.thebluealliance.com/team/4830), and [Team 5453](http://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5453)) will be visiting Stuyvesant! For Tuesday, we will be holding lectures for our visitors on various topics related to FRC and engineering. On Wednesday, we will have an engineering challenge involving marbles, and we'll be finishing off the day with a potluck dinner. 

Stay tuned for more updates as the week progresses!
