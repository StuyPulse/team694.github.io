Yesterday, members of our FRC and FTC teams had a demo at PS 110, an elementary school on the lower east side of Manhattan. We introduced them to FIRST by demoing a simple FLL robot made by one of our team members and two of our FTC robots. Two of our members helped the students add to the design of the FLL robot using legos. All the students were very engaged interacting with the robot. We hope to return to their school in future to continue inspiring future generations of engineers!
