After reaching semi-finals in the Hartford regional, we flew out to St. Louis for the world championship to compete in Archimedes. While we didn't break out of our division, the Einstein matches were a blast! Congratulations to [Team 610](http://team610.com/wordpress/), [Team 1241](http://www.theory6.ca/), and [Team 1477](http://www.texastorque.org/) on their championship victory!

With the book sale canceled on account of weather conditions, we're attending an off-season event, [Monty Madness](http://www.montymadness.com/) on Saturday, May 18. Team elections will be held on Friday, May 24.
