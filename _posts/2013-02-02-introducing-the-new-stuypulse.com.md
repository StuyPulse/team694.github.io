The StuyPulse Web Team is proud to present the brand spanking new team website! This is the first time our website has been completely overhauled since 2008.

For the new version of the site, we decided not to build or utilize a CMS like we did with our old site using PHP. Instead, the new site is completely static, and is built with the static site generator Jekyll. For more information about the new StuyPulse.com, check out the [About This Website](/about/website/) page.

Special thanks to Rachel Cantor at [Control Group](http://www.controlgroup.com/) for helping us to get started with Jekyll! I would recommend to anyone who is interested in exploring Jekyll to check out [this blog post](http://blog.controlgroup.com/2012/10/19/controlgroup-com-built-using-jekyll/) on their website.
