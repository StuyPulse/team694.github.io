In August, StuyPulse was once again invited to the third CRC (China Robotics Challenge)! We flew with many other international teams to Shanghai to mentor rookie and pre-rookie Chinese teams and help finish building and programming their robots. Our team was assigned to mentor one rookie and one pre-rookie team. After a few days, the CRC competition began! In the international elimination round, we ended as the sixth alliance captain with Team 16 and Team 5308 on our alliance. We ended the round in quarterfinals, but in the only-Chinese-team elimination round, one of the rookie teams we mentored won! Next year, the first Shenzhen regional will be hosted in China, and we are excited for the Chinese teams to be able to finally play in their home country!
