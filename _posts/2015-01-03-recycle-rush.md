Like always, we had our annual kickoff and potluck today.

We started the day off by watching the live stream. At one point, we had a nice surprise:

After going through the game manual with everyone, we broke for lunch.

Later, we split up into a few groups to puzzle over the game rules and discuss strategies. Some of the things we discussed included the main robot roles and functions, possible points per game, and auton strategies.

At the end of the day, we met back up again in the 3rd floor atrium, where part of the game field had been marked on the ground with tape, and shared our ideas. We also had the opportunity to play around with the game pieces (a pool noodle and a recycling bin), as well as a few crates, and experiment with different ways to orient and stack them.

All in all, everybody had a blast today, and it was great catching up with all the alumni. Thanks for coming, everyone!
