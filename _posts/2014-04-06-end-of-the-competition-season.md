First, thank you to everybody who came to the Javits Convention Center to cheer for our team in the NYC regional! It was a great time and we appreciate all the support.

StuyPulse reached quarterfinals in the elimination bracket, but did not win the regional. As such, we will not be heading to the world championship in St. Louis this year. However, be on the lookout for future announcement about off-season events!

And finally, congratulations to our incredible drive team, our extremely dedicated team members, our team mentors and teachers, all our families, and every one of our sponsors for seeing us through the 2014 FRC season. Our combined efforts makes our accomplishments possible, and we value the support given throughout the year.

Go StuyPulse!
