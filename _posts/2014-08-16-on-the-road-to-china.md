This morning, StuyPulse left NYC for China, where we will be staying for a week until August 22, to participate in the first ever Chinese FRC scrimmage. There will be three other American teams attending, including [Team 525](http://525swartdogs.org/), [Team 987](http://www.team987.com/), and [Team 1595](http://www.1595dragons.org/), along with eighteen Chinese FRC teams. 

Once we get there, we'll be participating in a series of workshops on a variety of topics, including safety, electronics, and scouting. Tomorrow, the competition will start! We'll keep you posted on further updates.
