Build season started off great at Kickoff! Members, alumni and mentors all came together in the theater to watch the unveiling of this year’s game, Stronghold. After watching the game animation together, we went over the game manual so that everyone would have a concrete understanding of this year’s game. Our team, wanting to start right away, formed small groups and started strategizing, making plans for the design for the robot, and setting goals and plans for future meetings. Some members even attended after-session meetings to pitch in ideas and to get a full grasp of what we would be doing and accomplishing as a team into the build season. We can’t wait to see what this year’s build season has in store for us! Good luck to all other teams!
