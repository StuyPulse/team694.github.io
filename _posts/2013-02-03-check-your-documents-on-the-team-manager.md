Attention team members! Want to check whether your paperwork, dues, and trip forms have all been filed? The Web Team has just launched a new feature on the Team Manager which allows you to check the status of all of your documents.

Just go to [manage.stuypulse.com](http://manage.stuypulse.com/), click on "Check the status of your documents", and enter your last name and 4-digit ID. There, you will be able to check the submission status of your:

- Safety tests
- Team dues
- Medical forms
- Parent and teacher trip permission forms
- Trip deposits and fees

You will also be able to verify your personal and parental contact information on the same page. If any information is incorrect, please inform Doris or Philipp.
