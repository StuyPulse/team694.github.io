Over the few weeks, StuyPulse has competed in two regionals: New York City and South Florida. Not only did our team members have a ton of fun, but our endeavors also lead to success. In New York City Regional, StuyPulse was a part of the winning alliance and received the Engineering Inspiration Award for encouraging those around us to dive into the STEM field. At South Florida Regional, StuyPulse and our alliance made it to the quarterfinals and we received the Entrepreneurship Award for our team's financial statement, strong partnership with sponsors, sustainability efforts, and outreach initiatives. We are ecstatic to be participating in at the championship at St. Louis and look forward to the great road ahead of us!
