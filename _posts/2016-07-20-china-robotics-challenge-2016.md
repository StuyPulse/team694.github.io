From August 4 to August 16, StuyPulse members will be traveling to Shanghai, China, where Team 694 has been invited to compete in the China Robotics Challenge as well as mentor a few teams. Because many Chinese teams are rookie teams, StuyPulse will be teaching them the basics and telling them all about being a FIRST team by hosting workshops. They will also be helping them with their robot directly and competing! Last year was a success and members had such a great time, and both returning members and new members cannot wait for what’s in store for them!
