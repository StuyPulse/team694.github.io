This past weekend, StuyPulse members attended the World Maker Faire at the NY Hall of Science. There, we talked to people of all ages about what our robot does as well as last yearâ€™s game, FIRST Stronghold. We also demoed our robot to all who attended and engaged young children and adults alike by giving them a chance to operate it and shoot a high goal. StuyPulse members had an amazing and unforgettable experience, and we hope to be invited for many years to come!
