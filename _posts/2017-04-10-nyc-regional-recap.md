New York City Regional was a blast! We competed at the Armory on April 7-9th, and had a great time! Rafael ranked 3rd out of 48 teams, and were 2nd alliance captain, with Team 333, MEGALODONS, and Team 4571, Rambots. After many tense matches, we became finalists! We also won the Entrepreneurship Award for our business plan. In addition, our Director of Public Relations, Yedoh Kang, was one of two Dean’s List Finalists, and will be competing at the St. Louis Championship for the Dean’s List Award! This was an amazing regional, and we can’t wait to compete at the World Championship at St. Louis from April 26th to the 30th! We couldn’t have made it this far without the support from our members, friends, coaches, parents, alumni, and sponsors! GO STUYPULSE!
