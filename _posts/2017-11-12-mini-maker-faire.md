Today, StuyPulse members had a great time with Barnes & Noble Tribeca participating in the Barnes and Noble Mini Maker Faire!
Members came and demoed the bot, and talked about the team, STEM, and FIRST.
Kids had fun operating the robot and letting it shoot fuel.
A voucher can be submitted on the Barnes & Noble online store with the code **12251245** and a percentage of the money will go to support our team.
The code is valid until Saturday, 11/18/2017.
Thanks in advance!
