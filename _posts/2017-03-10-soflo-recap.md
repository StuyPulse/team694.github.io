During March 1-4th, StuyPulse attended the South Florida Regional. There, members had a great time and experience, learning new lessons, enjoying the competition, and making new friends and connections. Rafael, our robot, ranked 8th out of the 48 teams, and we were chosen to be on the 2nd alliance with teams 1744 and 6038 for the elimination rounds. We unfortunately lost at Quarterfinals due to connection problems with our robot. However, our team won the Regional Chairmanâ€™s Award, the most prestigious award a FRC Team can receive, qualifying us to attend the St. Louis World Championship, during April 26-29th. We will also be competing in the NYC Regional from April 6-9th, and our team cannot wait for both of these competitions!
