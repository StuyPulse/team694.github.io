title: CRC Elimination Rounds

Elimination rounds were held today, the first ever in China. Because the event was for rookie teams, the American teams (Teams 525, 987, 1595, and us) did not play. However, we did play three great exhibition matches. Our team was awarded the Inspiration Award, as well as a set of five safety badges. Following this, there was a Q&A session to help the Chinese teams learn new things. We also exchanged contact information with them so that we could assist the teams throughout 2015 and beyond. 

Though the robot has been packed up and shipped back to the U.S., we will be holding (along with the other American teams) a series of instructional seminars pertaining to a range of subjects relevant to FRC to better prepare them for their coming year.
