Today at the Shenzhen CRC (China Robotics Challenge), StuyPulse went into the competition not only as a competitor but also as assistance, as this is the FRC competition there. As competitors, we invested time in fixing our robot due to damage sustained in travel. We helped out other teams and the event organizers as well. Many teams required help in passing their first inspection, and we also assisted the field setup crew in setting up the FMS connections. 

Finally, tomorrow marks the first qualification matches ever held in China. We wish everyone good luck!
