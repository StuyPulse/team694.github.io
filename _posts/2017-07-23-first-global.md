Members of StuyPulse had an amazing experience in Washington, D.C. at the inaugural FIRST Global Challenge!
They finally met in person the team they mentored, Team Hope, in addition to 162 other teams, representing over 150 countries.
After weeks of hard work and preparation, Team Hope built a great robot that performed very well
during their matches. Overall, the team members who attended the competition had an unforgettable experience,
with highlights including lengthy conversations with other FRC teams from around the world and meeting Dean Kamen.
