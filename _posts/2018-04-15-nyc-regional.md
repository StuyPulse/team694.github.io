Last weekend, we competed in the New York City Regional.
Wildcard made team history by going undefeated throughout the entire regional.
Along with teams 1796 and 743, we won the event, qualifying us for World Championships in Detroit later this month.In addition, we also qualified to compete at the championships by winning the Chairman’s Award, the most prestigious award that can be award to a FRC Team.

Congratulations to our coach, James Lonardo, for winning the Woodie Flowers Finalist, and our Vice President of Engineering, Navid Kashem, for winning Dean’s List Finalist!
We are so happy for their accomplishments and thankful for their contributions to the team.
Our success made us the 4th team to ever win three banners at the same regional.
Let’s go StuyPulse!
