Team members have finally come back from the CRC in China!
We would like to congratulate Teams 1986, 4613, 6706, and 9067 for winning the finals at CRC!
StuyPulse team members had a great time mentoring novice teams, helping teams build their robots, and teaching workshops.
They also were able to compete with the teams they mentored and reached Semi-Finals!
We are super proud of them and we look forward to going back next year!
Thank you China for the warm welcome and the wonderful hospitality!
