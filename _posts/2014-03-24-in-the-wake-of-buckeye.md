StuyPulse returns battered, but not beaten, from the Buckeye Regional in Cleveland, Ohio, placing as the 8th alliance captain. After being ousted in the quarterfinals of elimination matches, we're looking forward to the New York City Regional (April 4th to 6th). Come cheer with us at the Jacob Javits Convention Center!

STUYPULSE!
