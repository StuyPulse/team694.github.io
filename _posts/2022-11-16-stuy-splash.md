Stuy Splash will be held on December 10th, 2022 at 345 Chambers Street, New York City. It will be happening from 11:00 AM to 4:30 PM EST.

Stuy Splash is a series of lectures open to all FRC teams, veterans and rookies alike, throughout the northeast. The lectures cover a range of topics from pneumatics to finding sponsors, and are meant to teach teams more about FIRST and robotics.

Feel free to sign up even if you and your team cannot attend in person, since we are currently trying to implement a livestream system that will allow you to watch the presentations remotely.  On that note, we are also accepting virtual presenters!
