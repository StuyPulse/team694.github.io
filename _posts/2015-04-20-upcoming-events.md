Hello, everyone! Saturday, April 25, is our biannual book sale. We'll be selling books at the corner of Greenwich and Chambers. This coincides with the Tribeca Family Festival right around the corner, and we'll be presenting on the stage at the festival and displaying our robots. Feel free to come and help support the team!
