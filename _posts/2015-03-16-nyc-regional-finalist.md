Thank you to everyone who came to Javits this weekend to support our team at the NYC regional! We had an especially great time this year. We placed as the second alliance captain, and with the help of our awesome alliance partners [Team 354](https://sites.google.com/site/ghousepirates/) and [Team 271](http://www2.bayshoreschools.org/robotics/), we made it all the way to the finals.

Although we did not win the regional, we did win a few other awards. Our software engineering mentor, Jeanne Boyarsky, was named Volunteer of the Year. Yubin Kim, our Vice President of Marketing, won the FIRST Dean's List Finalist Award. And for the first time ever, our team won the Gracious Professionalism Award!

Our next competition will be at the Buckeye Regional at Cleveland, Ohio, on March 25-28. For those who won't be able to come with us to Buckeye, you can watch streams of the event when it starts at [The Blue Alliance](http://www.thebluealliance.com/).
