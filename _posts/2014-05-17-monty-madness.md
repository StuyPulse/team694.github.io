StuyPulse returned today from our first off-season event [Monty Madness](http://www.montymadness.com/) in Skillman, New Jersey. Although we did not win the event, we reached the quarterfinals in eliminations and had a great time. 

Also, our annual potluck dinner and silent auction is on Friday, May 30th. All mentors, alumni, parents, and students are welcome! You can sign up with any contributions (food, drinks, items for the silent auction) [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SMglViR9fvY1K5qDmPw9W2Qy0pnWMAKKKFkyoVuro-A/viewform). We hope to see you there!
