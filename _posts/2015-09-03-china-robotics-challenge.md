On August 10, StuyPulse, along with eight other international teams (Teams 118, 148, 359, 525, 987, 1538, 1595, 1772, 2468, 4613), flew to Shenzhen, China to attend the second CRC (China Robotics Challenge) event. Our first two days in Shenzhen consisted of helping the rookie Chinese teams finish building and programming their robots. After returning from a two day stay at Guilin, China, StuyPulse and the other international teams helped the Chinese teams with the final touches on their robot, preparing them for competition.  Members and mentors of our team also mentored the Chinese teams throughout our time together, teaching them from the experience we have after years of being an FRC team. 
The scrimmage lasted from August 17 until August 19. After the first day of practice matches, our robot seemed to be performing as expected and did not suffer any damage from shipment. We placed sixth after qualifications, and as the fifth alliance captain, we competed alongside our alliance members, Team 525 and Team 9015. Our alliance made it to semifinals, nearly grasping a seat in the finals. After eliminations with the international teams, the Chinese teams had another elimination round excluding all international teams.
Our trip to China was one we will never forget and we look forward to next yearâ€™s CRC event!
