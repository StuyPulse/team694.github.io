StuyPulse came back from the St. Louis World Championship only a week ago! It was such a great experience for everyone, and we all had a great time and learned so much! We were ranked 30th in the Daly Subdivision with a match record of 5-5-0 and an OPR of 129.12. We were picked as the "backup" bot for Alliance 7, and although we didn't play, we were glad that we were able to help out in many ways! In addition, we were able to see the Einstein matches and visit other teams' pits and see what they were doing in their own communities. Furthermore, we filmed some videos for FIRSTThoughts, which will be relaunching very soon! Again, our team wants to thank EVERYONE for helping us out this season -- without you, we couldn't have reached this far!
