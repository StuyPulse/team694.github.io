StuyPulse returned from Buckeye last week, having made it to the regional semifinals. Unfortunately, we did not reach the finals, and as such we will not be going to championship this year. Fear not, however - we will be participating in scrimmages as well as other off-season events.

As a last note, our 15th Anniversary dinner will be on Saturday, May 30th from 4 to 10pm. More details to follow soon. Keep on the lookout for announcements regarding future events!
