Wildcard is back from its first regional of this season!
We placed 5th seed.
Along with our alliance, teams 4253 and 810, we made it to semifinals.
Although we didnâ€™t get to finals, we are extremely grateful for this opportunity to learn from our mistakes and improve our robot for the next regional.
