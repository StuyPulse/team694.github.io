Hey everyone,<br>
NYS is looking to pass a <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/a5736/amendment/original">bill</a> that will give funding to NYS FIRST teams and those looking to start teams, to "help encourage students to study in the fields of STEM."
It would be great if you could take a minute to read it and support it!
