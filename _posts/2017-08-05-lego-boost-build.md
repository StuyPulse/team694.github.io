StuyPulse members had such a fun time teaching kids at TriBeCa Barnes & Nobles' LEGO Boost Build Event today!!!
We were all hard at work making Vernie the ðŸ¤–  shoot targets ðŸŽ¯,  dance to music ðŸŽµ, and climb over obstacles!!!
These kids were so motivated and innovative; we hope that they were inspired to continue STEM as they get older!
