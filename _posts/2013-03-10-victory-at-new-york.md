With the help of our awesome alliance partners <a href="http://connetquot-robotics.webs.com/" data-proofer-ignore>Team 3137</a>, and [Team 4797](http://www.thebluealliance.com/team/4797), we won the New York City Regional! Next up is the Connecticut Regional in Hartford (March 28th to 30th), and then we're off to the championship in St. Louis!

GO STUY!
